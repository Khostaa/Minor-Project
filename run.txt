Install Mosquitto Broker
add conf.txt file as specfied below to mosquitto folder of c://drive




[ Create Virutal Enviroment to avoid Conflict from system]
python -m venv env_name
source env_name/scripts/activate : to active virtual Enviroment

1. Establish Broker
2. make conf.txt file with these line:
	listener 1883
	allow_anonymous true
3. Establish SSH
	ssh username@dummy.local , or,
	ssh username@raspberrypi-ip
 user, dummy, ip as specified
4. Check Broker's IP:	
	ipconfig in terminal; 
	wireless lan adapter wifi's ip; is broker's IP
5. Check pi's IP using: ifconfig or directly from your hotspot connection.
   Subscriber and Publisher must be connected to same hotspot/wifi.
6. Update Broker's IP in code.
7. Check Subscriber's Ip for streaming.


(After establishing SSH, use VSCode Host for rest of the steps of subscriber)
8. connect to host from vscode and
	>run: python subscriber.py
	open new terminal and run command as in 7/ ffmpeg only!
9. Access Camera connected to raspberry pi using RTMP (Real Time Messaging Protocol)
	> sudo ufw allow 1935/tcp ; 1935 is default port
	> sudo systemctl reload nginx.service
	check nginx status
	>sudo service nginx status

	> only if nginx is not running: sudo service nginx restart
	> ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency -b:v 1500k -bufsize 3000k -pix_fmt yuv420p -g 30 -an -f flv rtmp://localhost/live/stream
8. update subsciber's IP to rtmp_url
9. Get Back to local host: run final.py/test.py
